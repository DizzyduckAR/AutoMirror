## Credits

*.txt Grep funcs

This library is based on the *Library for Text file manipulation* started by [Heresy](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=8193). I have contributed a number of functions to that library, but that version also has some "bugs" which are hopefully resolved in this TF library.

Thanks to:
Heresy, SKAN! (countlines, setwidth, spaces), Olegbl, (suggestion for find*), infogulch (suggestion for tab \<-\> spaces),
Murp|e (suggestions for documentation, check if file exists), ribbet.1 (New features in TF_LineNumber), Tuncay (help with
TF() and borrowed ideas for TAIL).
